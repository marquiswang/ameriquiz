			<h1>About <b>AmeriQuiz!</b></h1>
		</center>
		
		<p>
			<h5>
				AmeriQuiz! was designed to be a fun, interactive means for high school students to study American history.  Our goal in producing this game was to create a useful study tool that students would actually <i>want</i> to use in order to break the monotony of studying flash cards and note sheets. We hope that students will use our game to prepare for tests and AP exams as a fun way to refresh their knowledge of American history.  This game was designed in response to the Hidden Agenda project sponsored by Zynga as described <a href="http://facebook.com/haproject" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<h2>How To Play</h2>
		</center>
	
		<p> 
			When you press Play, a significant event from American history will immediately appear at the top of your window.  
			You must enter two pieces of information about each event. 
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<b>FIRST</b>, identify <b>when</b> the event took place by dragging the marker on the scrollbar at the bottom of the map.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<b>SECOND</b>, identify <b>where</b> the event took place by clicking on the appropriate location on the map.
		</p>
	
		<h4>
			And that's it!  The game will continue for as long as you wish to keep playing.  Good luck, and have fun!
